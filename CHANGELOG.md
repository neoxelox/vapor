# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) with pre-GA policy details defined in `docs/operations/release-process.md`.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0-alpha.2] - 2026-03-10

### Changed

- Hardened `lint`, `test`, `perf`, and `release` GitHub Actions workflows with explicit least-privilege permissions and non-persisted checkout credentials.
- GitHub Releases are now documented as the direct installation source for Vapor app builds.

### Fixed

- Release preflight now authenticates its `main` ancestry fetch correctly on GitHub-hosted runners when checkout credentials are not persisted.
- CI signing and notarization now run behind the protected GitHub `release` environment, verify the imported `Developer ID Application` identity, and pass the temporary keychain into `notarytool` explicitly.
- `./scripts/version.sh` now refreshes `Cargo.lock` through Cargo and keeps workspace package versions aligned with `VERSION` during release preparation.

## [0.2.0-alpha.1] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- Scoped local/cloud sync directory handling, including safe local root creation and strict sync-root boundaries.
- Gitignore-style filtering with recursive `.gitignore` and `.vaporignore` support plus pre/post user ignore rule layers.
- Locale catalogs with deterministic English fallback for app UI text.
- GitHub release automation with lint/test/perf-gated packaging, draft GitHub Releases, checksums, and release runbooks.
- Centralized `VERSION`-driven app + daemon versioning with build commit provenance surfaced in diagnostics and `vapord --version`.

### Changed

- Shared runtime/config constants are centralized across Swift and Rust so script, app, and daemon defaults stay aligned.
- Release preparation now goes through `./scripts/version.sh`, which creates the release commit and matching tag together.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- Initial project foundation for Vapor app and `vapord` daemon.
- Script-first build, lint, test, and packaging workflows.
- Baseline CI workflows for lint and test on `main` and pull requests.
